Fresh out of college, I worked as a professional video game developer for a startup that later got acquired by the Japanese gaming giant **DeNA**. During this time, I was part of the team that built **TapFish**, the top-grossing game worldwide, for two weeks in 2011, on both the App Store and Google Play.

I then went on to work at **Technology for People Initiative**, an applied research lab in my where I mined social media and cell phone data for proxies of socio-economic indicators that allowed more inclusive policy-making for marginalized communities. During these years, I also dabbled in data journalism and helped organize a boot camp on using data for journalists with the support of the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) and the Knight Foundation.
