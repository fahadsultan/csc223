I am excited to talk code 💻, algorithms 🔄 🔀 and software engineering 📊 in this course with you!

From the navigation bar on the top ☝🏾 and sidebar on the left 👈🏾, you should be able to navigate to any topic relevant to the course. If that does not help, there should also be a search icon 🔍 in the top left corner ↗️

👇🏾 Below, you can find important links and important announcements.
