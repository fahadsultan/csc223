### `if` Statements

* `if` statements are used to execute code **conditionally**.

* The code inside the `if` statement is executed **only if** the condition is `True`.

* The condition is a **boolean expression**.

* The code inside the `if` statement is **indented**.

* The `if` statement **ends** when the indentation ends. -->


## Flow / Directionality of Execution 

1. **Programs** (multiple lines of code) run each line of code sequentially **top to bottom**


2. **Statements** (single line of code) run **right to left**

    * Expression on right hand side of assignment/boolean operator is executed first
    
    * Then, left hand expression of assignment operator is executed


3. **Expressions** ( < 1 line of code) run as per rules of precedence; for operators of equal precedence, expressions run **left to right**.
