Data (values and variables) are to code what nouns are to prose.

Operations (arithmetic, logical, relational) are the verbs.

Control flow (if-else, loops) are the plot. 

Abstractions (functions, classes) are metaphors.

Programming in Java is different from programming in Python primarily because: 

* Java is a **statically typed** language.
* Every Java program must have a `main` method.
* Java is a **compiled** language, where Python is an **interpreted** language. 
* While Pythn is also object-oriented, Java is more **strictly** object-oriented.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
