    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate **variables**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to algebra, variables in computer programming are **names that refer to values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In algebra, the following statement declares that the variable `x` has the value `42`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = 42$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the following statement declares that the variable `x` has the value `42`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a just a name. Values are somewhere else, and a variable refers to a value. Multiple names can refer to the same value. Python calls whatever is needed to refer to a value a reference. Assigning to a variable (or object field, or ...) simply makes it refer to another value. The whole model of storage locations does not apply to Python, the programmer never handles storage locations for values. All he stores and shuffles around are Python references, and those are not values in Python, so they cannot be target of other Python references.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are the first means of abstraction in computer programming. They allow us to abstract away the details of the value and refer to computations in more general terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules for Naming Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore (variable names can not start with a number).\n",
    "\n",
    "* _**Variable Names must be descriptive!**_\n",
    "\n",
    "* A variable name **must start with a letter or the underscore character**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A variable name **cannot start with a number**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A variable name can **only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores** (`A-z`, `0-9`, and `_` )\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable names are **case-sensitive** (`age`, `Age` and `AGE` are three different variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, the convention is to **_NOT_ use upper case letters** anywhere in the name. In case of multi-word names, use `_` .\n",
